/*

/atom (Overridden)
------------------
Overridden /atom, containing tweaks to this type and additional
features.

Procedures:
	Click()
		Purpose:  Functions almost like a normal click, except it
		supports removing input focus based on the input object's
		settings.  Compatible with most objects derived from the
		/atom type (nearly any object in the world).
